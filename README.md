# C.L.A.R.B.E.
###### Or: C Language Assistant for Running and Building Ecosystems.

Is a cargo-like package manager and compiler for the C programming language.
I were tired of reading incredible C/C++ committee proposal papers which were not accepted in the language, so I created this manager for the lovers of C to try adding things they'd love to see in the language.

## Information

Of course this compiler doesn't follow the full C standard, since it's made by a single dev ;-;

## Dependencies
 - curl
 - toml++
 - rapidjson
