Is a compiler / cargo-like package and project manager for the C programming language.
I were tired of reading incredible C/C++ committee proposal papers which were not accepted in the language, so I created this manager for the lovers of C to try adding things they'd love to see in the language.

## Overview

the project's compromised of two parts, the compiler and project manager.
hence the compiler is not yet functional, the project manager will be a wrapper around other compilers such as clang or gcc

## Dependencies
 - curl
 - toml++
 - rapidjson

## Build dependencies
 - C/C++ compiler(gcc, clang, etc...)
 - git

## Installation
- Create a environment variable 'CLARBE_HOME' and add 'CLARBE_HOME/bin' to path
- Download the zipped source code, unzip and in the directory run in bash terminal ```bash build.sh```
- now run in terminal ```clarbe version```

## Usage
- use ```clarbe new <project_name>``` or go to an empty directory and use ```clarbe init```
- in the project directory there should be an include and source folders, as well as a "clarbe.toml" file.
- (Optional): If you want to change the compiler used, write:
> > ```toml
> > [build]
> > compiler="compiler_name"
> > ```
- Now write what you wish for the source code and run ```clarbe build```, then ```clarbe run```
